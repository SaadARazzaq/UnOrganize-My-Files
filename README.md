# UnOrganize-My-Files 📁🗑️🐍

This script is designed to un-organize files in a way that all files in subdirectories are moved to the parent directory of that subdirectory deleting that subdirectory afterwards. This is Helpful when we need to move all subdirectory files to a parent directory so that we may organize the files afterwards with our desire.

## 💡Intuition

When you run the script, it prompts you to enter a path to the directory containing the files you want to un-organize. The script then processes each file in the subdirectory, moving all subdirectory files to the parent directory.

## ⚒️Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the path of the directory you want to un-organize when prompted.
3. The script will move all files from that subdirectory to the parent directory deleting that subdirectory afterwards.

**Note**: This script is a basic un-organizer and might not cover all use cases. Use it with caution and consider backing up your files and folders before running the script.
